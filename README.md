* ngrx-basics - Includes NgRx 5 installation, scaffolding and basic implementation for getting a list of heroes via the store
* ngrx-complete - Splitting everything up into smart/dumb components with full conversion to NgRx
* ngrx-sidekicks (in progress) - Shows how to implement NgRx via lazy-loaded modules
